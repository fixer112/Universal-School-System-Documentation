## Local Development
The universal school system API requires node version 10 and above to run successfully.

The following steps must be undertaken in order for the code of this project to work as intended.

```
1. Clone the repo to your local machine using the **git clone repo url** command.
2. Using the terminal, navigate to the cloned directory **cd Universal-School-System**
3. Install all the project's dependencies and devDependencies using the **npm install -d** command.
4. Create a mongoDB database on mongodb atlas and insert your connection string in your own local .env file
5. Create environment variables for the following:
     NODE_ENV
     PORT
     MONGODB_URI
     JWT_EXPIRATION_TIMEFRAME
     JWT_EXPIRY_TIME
     SECRET
     ADMIN_CODE
     TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID
     TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN
     TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER
     PAYSTACK_SECRET
     SUBSCRIPTION_AMOUNT
6. Start the server, using the command **npm start**.
7. Congratulations, your api should be up and running.
```

## Tools and Technologies Used For This Project
* Node (JavaScript Runtime)
* Express (Node Framework)
* MongoDB (Database)
* TWILIO (Sending Text Messages)

## API Features
This API consists of the features indicated below:

### Authentication
* This API makes use of Json web tokens for authentication.
* The users of this application are assigned a unique token upon a successful register or login operation. This token is very important for later HTTP requests to the API for authentication.  Requests to the API that are carried out without authentication (when authentication is needed) will recieve a fail json response with the status code 401: Unauthorized Access. The token should be attached to the request's header as the value of the authorization key. 
* The token goes through a verification process, anytime a logged in user wants to have access to special resources that are reserved for authenticated users.
* When clients make a request to the logout endpoint a **null token** is returned in the json response.
* Administrators, students, staff and parents have different authentication handlers.
* A single person cannot be registered twice for one collection. For instance, a teacher who is already registered, cannot register again as a teacher, but can register as a parent.
* Logged in Users can update their password, anytime they like, especially if their current password is compromised.
  
### Notice

When a user registers with the platform, the user must verify the phone number that was used in the creation of the account.

To achieve this, the logged in user must make a get request to the */api/v1/users/me/verification_code/* endpoint to get a verification code.

The logged in user, then makes a post request with the verification code to the */api/v1/users/me/verify_my_account/* endpoint to verify his or her account.

From then on, the user can have access to any resource on the platform that is accessible to users with verified accounts.

### Register Student

If your parent is already registered on the platform, it is recommended that you provide their phone number. However, this is not required.

When the parent has registered on the platform, the student can update his or her account details to include his or her parent's phoneNumber, using the **updateMe** endpoint.

If the student puts in the wrong parent phone number, when updating his or her account an error will be returned.

A student cannot be connected to any parent whose phone number they do not provide.

### Register Staff
* A school staff can either be a school-administrator or a principal or a vice-principal or a teacher or a form-teacher or a bursar.
* If you do not specify your role, the default is teacher. 

The School-Administrator does not have to specify the school name and address, when signing up, because the school may not be in existence yet,
since it is the School-Administrator who registers a school with the platform after creating his or her account.

When the school has been registered, the School-Administrator can update his account details to include the school name and address, using the **updateMe** endpoint

If the School-Administrator puts in the wrong school name and address, when updating his or her account an error will be returned. 

A staff cannot be connected to a school when they do not provide the school name and address.

* Request
    * Endpoint: POST/api/v1/staff/register
    * Body: (application/json)

### Resetting Passwords
The different category of users have different endpoints for resetting their passwords.

However, they must all follow two main steps:

* They make a post request with their phone number to their forgot_password route.
* They send their reset code along with their new password and a confirmation of the new password in a patch request to their reset_password route
  
  This how the forgot_password route of each category of user looks like:
  * For ADMIN: /api/v1/admin/forgot_password
  * For STUDENT: /api/v1/student/forgot_password
  * For PARENT: /api/v1/parent/forgot_password
  * For STAFF: /api/v1/staff/forgot_password

This how the reset_password route of each category of user looks like:
  * For ADMIN: /api/v1/admin/reset_password
  * For STUDENT: /api/v1/student/eset_password
  * For PARENT: /api/v1/parent/eset_password
  * For STAFF: /api/v1/staff/eset_password

For demonstration purposes I will work wth only an admin. 

Rest assured, the other category of users follow thesame pattern, with the exception of having seperate endpoints, which have been explained above.
